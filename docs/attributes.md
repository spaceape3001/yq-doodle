#! Attributes

Attributes are the way the user defines shapes, attributes can either be straight up numbers or also be a user expression string or something else.  (This determination should be made at analysis time.)

## Naming

Attributes that are intended as expressions have to be mindful that some constants can conflict, and these are the current pre-defined constants.
